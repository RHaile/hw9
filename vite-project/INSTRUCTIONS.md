### Homework Assignment: Building a React Application

#### Objective
Create a dynamic web application using React. The application should have multiple interactive components and utilize props and `useState` for data handling.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Application Design**:
   - Choose a theme or idea for your application (e.g., a to-do list, blog, weather app).
   - Sketch out the layout and identify the components needed.

2. **Setting Up the Environment**:
   - Initialize a new React project using Create React App.
   - Organize your project structure with components, utilities, and assets.

3. **Developing Components**:
   - Build your individual React components.
   - Ensure proper use of props for data handling between components.

4. **Implementing State Management with `useState`**:
   - Use the `useState` hook for state management in your components.
   - Ensure your components can respond to user interactions and state changes.

5. **UI and Interactivity**:
   - Style your components using CSS or a styling library.
   - Implement user interaction and event handling.

6. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test your application for bugs and performance issues.
   - Refine and optimize your code and UI.

#### Deliverables
Submit a link to your GitHub repository containing:
- The complete React project code.
- A README file detailing the project, how to run it, and any other necessary documentation.

4. **Component**: A reusable piece of UI in React, which can be a function or a class.
5. **State**: An object that determines the behavior and rendering of a React component, changeable over time.
6. **useState**: A hook in React that lets you add state to functional components.
7. **Event Handling**: The process of managing user interactions in a web application, such as clicks, input changes, etc.
